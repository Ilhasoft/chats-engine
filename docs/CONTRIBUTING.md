# How to Contribute

Weni Chats is an open source project, so we made this document to make the process for contributing clear and answers some questions that you may have.

## Branch Organization
You can submit all changes to the `develop branch`, where we do whole our tests for new features

## Flags for your branch

To keep the `develop branch` in a releasable state, breaking changes and experimental features must be gated behind a feature flag.

#### New Feature
Use this flag to create a branch for new features
 - `feature/feature_name`

#### Bug fix
Use this flag to fix some bug
- `bugfix/bug_name`
